Several approaches can resolve this type of error.  First, ensure that your project's dependencies are correctly installed and that your `package.json` is up-to-date.  Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to verify.  Next, double-check your project structure to ensure it adheres to Expo's conventions. Incorrect file paths or missing configurations could confuse the bundler. Cleaning your cache often helps: `expo start --clear`. If the issue persists, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling dependencies.  As a last resort, consider creating a new Expo project and progressively moving your code into the new structure to isolate the problem.  The error messages often give clues to the problem if you examine them carefully. Focus on things like: if a module is not found; if a dependency has a version conflict; etc.
